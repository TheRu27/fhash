### Fork of [fHash](https://github.com/sunjw/fhash) — an open source files hash calculator

This fork adds the following features to the **macOS** version:
 * **Folder support** — select or drag & drop folders to hash all files inside. When a folder contains subfolders, the app asks whether to process recursively or top level only.
 * **Pause / Resume** — pause and resume hash calculation at any time using the Pause button (replaces Clear during calculation).
 * **Resizable window** — removed minimum window size constraint.

> **Note:** This fork has only been tested on macOS with Apple Silicon (M-series) processors.
